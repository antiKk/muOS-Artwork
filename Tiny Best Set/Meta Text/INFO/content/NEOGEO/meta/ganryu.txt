One month has passed since Musashi defeated his sworn enemy, Kojiro. Musashi was on the way to Kyoto, where his beloved Otsu was waiting for him. Around this time, many abductions had occurred by a mysterious group of ninjas, and Otsu was one of the missing. What is the true purpose of these ninjas? The time to fight has come again for Musashi!!

You must guide Musashi or his sister, Suzame, around several locations defeating a horde of ninjas with only a sword. Weapon power-ups and life bonuses can be collected along the way. You can jump high and use your grappling hook to attach to and climb some ceilings, as well as attaching yourself to faraway objects. At the end of each location, you must defeat a guardian in order to continue the game. Cut-scenes are viewed between locations.
