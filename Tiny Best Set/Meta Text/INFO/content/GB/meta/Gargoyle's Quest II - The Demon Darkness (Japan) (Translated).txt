Firebrand is a young warrior-in-training from the town of Etruria. One day, while Firebrand is training in a small, alternate dimension, the Black Light suddenly appears and destroys his home. When he returns successfully from his training, he is told to hurry to the King by another ghoul just before it dies. Upon defeating Nagus, Firebrand is able to meet with King Morock, who informs Firebrand he is on the brink of death. Before dying, he gives Firebrand the Spectre's Fingernail and Firebrand sets off on a journey to unravel the mystery of the Black Light.
