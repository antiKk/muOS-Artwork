Gameplay consists of a platform game. Kirby is like no other platform character of its time because he can fly with no power-ups, and he can swallow enemies and get their powers. In addition to that, Kirby can now team up with his friends: Rick the hamster, Kine the fish, and Coo the owl. Each team-up has it's advantages and disadvantages, but Kirby can still swallow enemies, making more different powers available depending on the power/friend combination.
