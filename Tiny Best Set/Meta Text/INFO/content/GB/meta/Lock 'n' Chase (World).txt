There's money to be had, and it's waiting to be nabbed. Be an ace in Lock'N Chase. 
 
This classic arcade game invites you to play as a thief who's trying to score big by collecting his weight in gold. Duck in and out of alleys while scooping up coins along the way. Maybe you'll get lucky and find some extra treasure. But being on the wrong side of the law is never easy, as the police are hot on your tail. If you think they're coming too close, try using a sliding door or power-up items to block their chase.
