Radioactive energy is destroying every living thing on Earth. Only Jason can stop it. And this time, he can't use his super-equipped car. He's gotta do it alone. Armed with blistering lanterns, mega-power hyper-bombs and skull-rattling super-bombs, Jason must blaze a dizzying path deep down beneath the surface of the planet to seek out the Mutant Bosses - then destroy them! Can you help Jason fight his way to the center of the Earth? He's running out of light. He's running out of time. And only you can make sure Jason blasts his enemies - before they blast him.
