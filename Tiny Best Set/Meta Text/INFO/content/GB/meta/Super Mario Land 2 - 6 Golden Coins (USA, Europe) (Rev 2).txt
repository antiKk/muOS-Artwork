Second in the Game Boy's line of Mario games, this one takes the evolutionary steps that Super Mario 3 for the NES took with it's predecessors. New graphics, power-ups, challenges, and a completely original storyline. A bad version of Mario, Wario, takes over Mario's castle and locks him out using 6 golden coins. Mario must search for said coins all over Mario Land to take back his castle and go one-on-one with Wario himself.
