One day, Mickey and his friends went for a walk in a forest. They became so distracted by all the natural beauty surrounding them, they got lost. Pretty soon, they discovered a haunted castle. "That's the witch Yashja's castle," they told each other. "Once you enter, you can never escape! The castle is full of tricks and traps and even magic wands to create ice and fire. Let's not get any closer!" 
 
All this chatter aroused Yashja from her slumber. "So! Who dares disturb my sleep?" she yelled. "You all shall pay!" Suddenly, a gaping hole opened up under Mickey's friends and they all fell in. Now Mickey has to save his friends, who are now being held captive by the witch! 
 
To save his friends, Mickey has to collect puzzle pieces that completes images of his Disney friends, including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and even obscure characters like Grandma Duck from the comic book series. To do this, Mickey has to wave his wand over crystals which conceal not only pieces of the image, but also items and even an occasional enemy. Each big level has ten small stages, each with at least one image to complete. Each tenth stage has an end boss to defeat. Also, the image to complete in the tenth stage of each level reveals the Disney character being held captive by the end boss of that level.
