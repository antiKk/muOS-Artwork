Metal Masters is a one versus one fighting game with robots. Each robot has two basic attacks: ranged and melee; which one is used depends on how close the opponent is. In each scenario, the player can control the attacks of the robot: when in ranged mode the used weapon system is chosen (each of the four body parts has its own) and during melee combat, the direction of the punches is controlled. 

Each successful hit gives points which decide the winner if no fighter goes down within the time limit. A knockdown is achieved by emptying the opponent's life bar. Additionally each hit (with a big bonus for winning) gives prize money which in turn is invested in upgrading the robot. The player can buy new parts for the four components (main body, legs and the individual arms) - but an upgraded robot also influences the difficulty of the next enemy. While being inside a fight, the AI can be set to take over the own robot.
