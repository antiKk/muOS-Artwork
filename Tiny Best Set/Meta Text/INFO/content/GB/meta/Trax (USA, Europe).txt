Trax is a side scrolling shoot'em up game that put you in command of a tiny tank in some classic action levels. Pitting your tankmanship against a villainous tank master who is creating machine of destruction that has taken over the land.

You can fire from multiple angles but due to the control limitations of the Game Boy, your vehicle can only turn his turret clockwise.

There are a few power ups which increase your weapons like explosive cannonballs, multi-direction shots or anti-armor shells. 

The game also features some boss fights as you progress through the game's several different environments, forest, desert, cave, city, and tank factory.
