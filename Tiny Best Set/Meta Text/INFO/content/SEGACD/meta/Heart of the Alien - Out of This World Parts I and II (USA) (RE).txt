Heart of the Alien is a cinematic platformer video game developed by Interplay Entertainment and Virgin Interactive and was released by Virgin Interactive in 1994 for the Sega CD exclusively in North America. It is a sequel to Another World and continues the story directly from where the original ended. The game switches the player's role from Another World; this time the player takes control of Buddy, the main character's alien ally from the previous game. 
 
The story picks up immediately after the end of Another World. Buddy lands the pterodactyl in the ruins of his village, lays Lester down on a cot to rest and walks through the village, thinking of his past. This sequence contains many flashbacks of events that lead up to Buddy's capture and his and Lester's escape from prison. In the game, Buddy is searching for the red-eyed alien responsible for the destruction of his village and the imprisonment of his people. Buddy enters again the prison in search of the red-eyed alien. 
 
Near the end of the game, Lester who wakes back up, helps Buddy out, but then dies in the process. Buddy then goes to find again the red-eyed alien in a fortress. Eventually, he is able to find him and traps him in a cage with a beast that kills him. At the end of the game, Buddy gives Lester's body a ceremonial cremation. It is shown later how Buddy's village is rebuilt with its citizens living again in harmony.
