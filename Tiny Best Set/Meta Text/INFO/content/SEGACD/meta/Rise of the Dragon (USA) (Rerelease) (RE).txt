A futuristic adventure game that borrows graphical elements from Blade Runner (in fact, the title character's name is "Blade Hunter").  You must find out what is killing--by horrible, spontaneous mutation--inhabitants of the city, before it's too late.  An oriental cult, drugs, and street informants are among the places you find clues.
