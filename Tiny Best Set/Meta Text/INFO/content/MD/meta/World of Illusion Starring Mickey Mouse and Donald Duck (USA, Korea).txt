World of Illusion is sort of a follow-up to Castle of Illusion. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are taken to a magic world and have to get back home. In order to do that, they can play magical tricks and interact to each other in a 2-player mode. Like other Disney games for SEGA consoles of the same period, the game has cartoon-like graphics and is played as a side-scrolling platformer.
