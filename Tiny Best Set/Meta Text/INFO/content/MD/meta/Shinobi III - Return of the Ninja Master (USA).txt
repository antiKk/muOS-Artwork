Shinobi III involves a ninja named Joe "Shinobi" Musashi (you) going and kicking some bad guy butt, in this case his old enemy "Neo Zeed".

In normal Shinobi style, you are presented with side-scrolling playfields which you must slash and shuriken your way through, to meet the end boss of each round.
