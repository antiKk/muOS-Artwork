A jovial fantasy yarn, Landstalker is the title that put Climax Entertainment on the map.  Following the exploits of elvish treasure hunter, Nigel, and his pixie friend, Friday, they travel to a distant island to find the long lost treasure of King Nole.

The game can draw many parallels to the Zelda series, due to the game’s mostly whimsical style and emphasis on item collecting.  However, Landstalker is more meticulous, moving at a slower and more developed rate, with an abundance of towns and NPCs rounding out the cast.
