Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.
