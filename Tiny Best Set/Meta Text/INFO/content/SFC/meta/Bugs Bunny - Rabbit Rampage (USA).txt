A fiendish animator has gone crazy and has started painting Bugs Bunny into all sorts of messes across reused cartoon landscapes. Bugs is getting into trouble from all kinds of characters including Elmer Fudd, Marvin the Martian, Crusher the wrestler, Yosamite Sam, the three little pigs. Bugs will need to use his experience, wit, and arsenal of wacky ACME weapons in order to defeat the challenges of each location.

Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage is a side-scrolling platform game. The player, controlling Bugs Bunny, is able to jump (and squash), high-kick, throw cream pies and use ACME weapons. These weapons are scattered all over the landscape and include such cartoon favorites as bone-shaped dynamite sticks, anvils to drop on heads, Shrink Rays, portable holes and many more. Players will encounter a variety of familiar Looney Tunes characters as enemies and level bosses. At the end of each level (10 in all). players are given a rating based on their gameplay style, which includes how many of these ACME weapons they were willing to use.
