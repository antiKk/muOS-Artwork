Who killed Mr. Boddy? Was it Colonel Mustard, in the Kitchen, with the Lead Pipe? All the deductive fun of the classic mystery game comes to life with hundreds of animated vignettes, crisp graphics, bright colors, and refined sound effects and music of advanced 16-bit technology. Playing alone or with up to five human or computer opponents, you'll solve a new CLUE® mystery every time you play, as you choose one of five "ranks" and work up from Amateur to Detective. 
 
So enter Mr. Boddy's mansion and start collecting evidence from the animated vignettes that show Suspects skulking through Rooms and leaving fingerprints on Weapons. When you've collected enough clues, make your Accusation of Whodunit? Where? With which Weapon? If you're right, you'll see the murder reenacted before your very eyes!
