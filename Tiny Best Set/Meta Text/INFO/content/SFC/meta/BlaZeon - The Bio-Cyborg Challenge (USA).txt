BlaZeon is a space shooter and direct conversion of the arcade game. The player travels in a spaceship from the left side of the screen to the right while swarms of enemy spaceships appear. The player is able to fire at them with his cannon (which can be fired normally or rapid fire) and special missile weapon. After the defeat of certain enemies they will leave behind their husk. Touching this former enemy will allow the player to upgrade their spaceship into more powerful forms.
