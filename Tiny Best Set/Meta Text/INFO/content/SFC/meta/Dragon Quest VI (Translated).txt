"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called "Dragon Warrior" in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor  Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.
