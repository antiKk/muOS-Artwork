Conceived as an entry for a game development competition, this game would later be published by Naxat Soft in 1992.  This frenetic shoot-'em-up taxes the Famicom system and the player's reflexes with huge quantities of enemies while maintaining smooth, fast gameplay!  In addition to a single player campaign, there are also score attack and time attack modes available.
