Circus Charlie is a single-player abstract platform game in which the player must guide the eponymous Charlie through six different circus events. Bonus points can be won by finishing a level as quickly as possible, with further points awarded for collecting any of the money bags that occasionally appear. 
 
Finally, additional bonus points are awarded for completing a level without losing a life. The game is over when all Circus Charlies are lost. 
 
The six different events are: 
Ride a lion and jump through fiery hoops and over blazing pots.  
Jump over monkeys while walking a tightrope.  
Bounce on trampolines, avoid fire breathers and sword jugglers.  
Jump on giant, rolling beach balls.  
Ride a horse while avoiding obstacles.  
Trapeze.
