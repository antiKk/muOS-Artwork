Crude Buster © 1990 Data East.

In the near future, ruthless gangs are the new rulers of the streets. Only a brave duo of seasoned street brawlers can end this terror and return peace to the streets. Don't forget to grab and use anything you can find as a weapon (pipes, stones, signs, cars, even enemies!) to survive this onslaught. Features solid graphics & sound and very fun gameplay mechanics!
