Bubble Bobble II, also known as Bubble Symphony, is the first direct sequel to Taito's 1986 platform classic, "Bubble Bobble" ('Rainbow Islands' was the first official sequel, but played very differently) in which one or two players take on the role of the infamous bubble-blowing dinosaurs who must once again fight their way through a large number of single-screen platform-based levels, trapping monsters with their bubbles before bursting them to destroy the trapped enemies.  
 
While the game plays identically to its predecessor, several new changes and additions have been made to breathe new life into the classic gameplay. As well as new bonuses, weapons, enemies and characters, players can now create 'Multiple Bubbles'; if the player holds the button down for a few seconds before releasing, up to three bubbles are produced at once.
