Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is the fourth Marvel Comics-licensed fighting game produced by Capcom and the second installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. It is a sequel to X-Men vs. Street Fighter which replaces most of the X-Men characters with characters from Marvel Super Heroes. In an attempt to balance the previous game's problems, the game engine was altered, although it remained aesthetically the same which is what the game was criticized for. The game was released for the arcade in 1997 
 
Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter features a roster of 17 playable fighters, with nine characters from the Street Fighter universe and eight heroes from the Marvel Universe, It utilizes the same one-on-one tag team format previously employed in X-Men vs. Street Fighter.  
The player chooses a team of two fighters, each sporting their own life gauge; at the start of the match, the first selected character is controlled by the player, while the second character remains off-screen and acts as support.
