Welcome to no holds barred hockey brought to you by the Video Hockey League.  It's the Reds versus the Blues, the VHL's biggest rivalry. 
 
The same hockey rules apply, pass the puck around around the ice rink and shoot it past the opposite goalie to score. You can also check your opponent just like real hockey, only each character has their own bone-crushing way of checking, each with maximum impact and zero tolerance for your well-being.  Players can also start fights with one another to really spice things up. 
 
For an additional credit, players can purchase a 'power drink' that will make them 'Skate Faster and Shoot Harder' at the start of the period for one minute. 
 
Now get to the action and DROP THAT PUCK!
