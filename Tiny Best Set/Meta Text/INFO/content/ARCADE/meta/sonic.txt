Segasonic The Hedgehog is a scrolling, isometric racing game for one to three players featuring Sega's legendary mascot, 'Sonic the Hedgehog'. Sonic's nemesis, 'Dr. Robotnik', is once again intent on World domination and is preparing to launch his latest attack from his new island base, Eggman Island. 
 
When 'Sonic', 'Ray', and 'Mighty' drop in to thwart his plans, Robotnik catches them with one of his devious machines. After finding themselves imprisoned in a tower, the trio break free onto the island, and proceed to make their escape and try to defeat Robotnik and his evil plans. 
 
Sega Sonic's gameplay retains elements of the original console games, such as Sonic's ability to jump on the heads of enemies to kill them. The golden rings that Sonic collects are also included. Each level is littered with Dr Robotnik's devious traps; with lava flows, collapsible platforms, locked gates etc. all serving to hamper Sonic's progress.
