When a vicious crew of aliens decides to hone in on Earth and do some damage, you're the planet's only hope for salvation. You'd better be in top form as you command a killer spacecraft out into orbit in hopes of rescuing humanity from unthinkable misery. Each of the eight stages in PROJECT S-11 poses unique challenges, and each setting is more harrowing than the last. Although you're going it alone in this one, there are four different types of power-ups hidden throughout the game to give the boost you'll need to survive and wipe out the terrifying extra-terrestrials. You'll benefit from a complete statistical readout that adorns the right side of your screen, keeping you abreast of all necessary information: your score, your ship's armor level, and the number of bombs you have stored up for combat. The game's fast-paced action looks excellent in full color, and the intensity of it will have you breaking a sweat before you're through the first level. Those aliens had better look out with you at the controls, Earth stands a fighting chance.
