Makai Prince Dorabocchan ("Demon Prince Dorabo") is a 2D platformer for the PC Engine. The player controls the titular character who is on a quest to rescue his master and defeat the evil demons that have invaded the kingdom. 
 
As well as his own magical powers, he can be upgraded by finding suits of armor which boost his abilities as well as temporary power-ups that provide double-jumping, a syringe weapon that stuns enemies and cleats that allow him to jump on enemies to defeat them. If he finds a bat with a bell, he can summon his burly Moai guardians who use their stone bodies to create bridges that allow Dorabo to move forward or find secret areas.
