Based on Lewis Carrol's Alice in Wonderland novels, Fushigi no Yume no Alice is a cute 2-D platformer which casts you as Alice, a blond-haired girl wearing a pink dress. Your job is to make your way through forests and caves, defeating enemies that you come across by either jumping on their heads or shouting 'IYA' at them. Some enemies will drop eggs which will explode. You can kick these eggs and use them to destroy the enemies themselves. There are three levels in each area, and each level ends with you defeating a boss.
