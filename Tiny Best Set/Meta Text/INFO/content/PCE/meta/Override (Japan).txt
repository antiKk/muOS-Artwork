Override is a vertically-scrolling shooter in which the player controls a fighter craft on a mission to stop an alien invasion of the Earth. Much of the action takes place on planet surfaces, and enemies include spaceships of various kinds as well as ground enemies, mobile (tanks) or stationary (turrets). The player-controlled craft begins with two lives with three hit points each; restoring power-ups can repair the plane or increase its number of lives. 

Other power-ups come in two varieties: strength-increasing or secondary weapons. Depending on the color, the latter grants the plane wingmen with laser attacks, spreading fire, side lasers, rotating energy balls, etc. The strength of secondary weapons can be increase by flying over strength-increasing power-ups as well. Special weapon that hurts all enemies on screen must be activated by charging, which is achieved by not pressing the fire button for a certain amount of time.
