Never one to leave a good thing to be forgotten, Hudson are back with the third installment of the ever present Bomber Man series, and with this one comes a few changes. Apart from our dumpy little hero having lost a little weight since '93, the gameplay has also been altered significantly. While still retaining the basic bombing action, completing a level now no longer requires you to destroy all enemies on screen. Instead, you have to find and destroy a set of pillars on each level and these will unlock a broken piece of amulet from its protected dome. Collect the piece and all remaining destructible blocks turn into coins and you have about 15 seconds to collect as many as possible. Another major addition is kangaroo-type animals that you can jump on and ride. These have special abilities, like jumping and such and also count as an extra hit in case you walk into an enemy or stupidly blow yourself up.
