Sonic Battle is a fast paced pseudo-fighting game akin to Super Smash Bros. Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, the game employs a 3D isometric view that is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The character sprites are 2D.

There are 9 characters to choose from and 5 modes of play: Story, Battle, Challenge, Training, and Mini Games. You can link up 4 GBA's to fight your friends, and each character has several different attacks. It has a system of selecting Aerial, Ground, and Guard based attacks. Depending on what type of attack you set for which area (aerial/ground/guard) you have a possibility of 9 total different special attacks to choose from (only 3 at a time in a match though) which you can change each time you lose 1 stock point.

The game includes a trainable character whose abilities and techniques you can raise and add to. You get to pick and choose every aspect of the robot's style (running, attacking, jumping, dashing, etc.).

The game takes a moderate amount of time to play through as all the characters, and adds a longer lifespan to itself if you wish to play through and beat it completely (all characters, get all moves for the trainable robot, etc).
