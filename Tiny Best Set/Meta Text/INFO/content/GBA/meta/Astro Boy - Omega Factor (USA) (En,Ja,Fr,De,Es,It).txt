The game brings classic 2D gaming to the Game Boy Advance along with an original seven-episode story. Playing as Astro Boy, you'll learn about justice, compassion, evil, courage, and the history of Astro Boy--all while building Astro's Omega Factor and strengthening his character and superhuman abilities.
