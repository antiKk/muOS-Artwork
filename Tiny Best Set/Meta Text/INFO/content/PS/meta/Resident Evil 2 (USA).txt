Resident Evil 2 takes place two months after the events of the first game and is set in Raccoon City, a Midwestern mountain community whose residents have been turned into zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. In their escape from the city, the two protagonists Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield encounter other survivors and are confronted by William Birkin, the mutated creator of the even more powerful G-virus. 
 Previously confined to an old mansion, the Umbrella corporation's legacy of fatal mutations has spilled over into nearby Raccoon City. The once peaceful town is now overrun with zombies and all manner of genetic mutations. New police recruit Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield; the sister of STARS agent Chris Redfield, find themselves in the middle of an experiment gone horribly wrong.
