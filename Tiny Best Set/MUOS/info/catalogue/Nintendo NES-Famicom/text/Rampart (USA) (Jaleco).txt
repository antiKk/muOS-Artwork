A medieval masterpiece of power, strategy, and ingenuity! 
 
The objective is brutally simple: engage your enemy in an all-out exchange of cannonfire, then assess the damage and rebuild your castle. 
 
But the reality of RAMPART is far more complex. The key to victory lies in how quickly you can pick up the pieces and redesign, refortify, and extend your walls before the next battle begins. 
 
Whether you're facing an onslaught from the computer's armada, or pitting your castle cannons against another player's, there's only one way out. Defend... or perish.
