Mappy the mouse has a girlfriend named Mapica. In order to please his girlfriend, Mappy goes on a mission to collect gifts for his significant other. Unfortunately the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of pink cats want to track Mappy down so they can make a meal out of him. The goal of the game is to collect 6 of 1 item in each stage without getting eaten by a cat. The items you collect (either pieces of cheese, wedding rings, christmas trees, or baseballs) vary depending on what stage your playing.  There are also stage specific items in the background that will help you defeat your feline adversaries.
