The Jetsons: Cogwell's Caper is based on the well-known Jetsons property from Hanna-Barbera. In this spin-off adventure, George Jetson is tasked my his employer to put a stop to the profit-making schemes of the rival Cogswell's company. To do this, George must hop from location to location in his jet and conquer each level using the resources available to him, as well as with the assistance of the other Jetson franchise characters.

Cogswell's Caper is a side-scrolling action game where George Jetson can walk, crouch, and jump (actually, he's too lazy to jump and a jet pack handles the jumping duty for short bursts). Each level is littered with crates and other items that George can pick up and toss at enemies, while finding useful items (and occasionally even more enemies) underneath them. Since the game is set in the futuristic world of the Jetsons, there are also copious switches on walls which activate all kinds of features of the surroundings, such as a switch that reverses gravity for a brief time.
