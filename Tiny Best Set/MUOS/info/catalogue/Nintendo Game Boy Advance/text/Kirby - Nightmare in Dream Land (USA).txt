Everyone in Dream Land has lost the ability to dream! It seems that King Dedede has stolen the Star Rod, the source of power for the Fountain of Dreams, and given its fragmented pieces to his goons for safekeeping. The world needs a hero... a round pink one. As Kirby embarks on an adventure to recover the Star Rod, he'll have to copy every trick in the book to bring good dreams back to Dream Land.
