In a terrible mishap, Spyro, Sparx, and the Professor have inadvertently torn a hole in the fabric of space between the Rhynoc and Dragon Realms. Now, at the command of the elusive Ripto, droves of Rhynocs are pouring into the Dragon Realms in yet another attempt to make life miserable. As Spyro, Agent 9, or Sergeant Byrd, you must help the Professor close the hole quickly before the gate becomes too big and the two realms fuse together--permanently. You can use Spyro's new abilities, including the Head-Butt Slam, Cyclone Attack, Phoenix Vision, and more.
