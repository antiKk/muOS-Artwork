Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.
