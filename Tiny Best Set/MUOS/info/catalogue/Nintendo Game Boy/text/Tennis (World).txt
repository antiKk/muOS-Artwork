Tennis is, as the name implies, Nintendo's version of the sport. One player vs computer or two players will compete in tennis in a more or less standard suite of rules (scoring, sets etc.).

Players are controlled by the movement buttons, but while button A indicates a low hit, button B indicates a high one. You have the choice of four levels of computer AI, or two player via Game Boy link cable. The usual assortment of shots are available, including forehand and backhand, lobs and volleys when up close to the net.
