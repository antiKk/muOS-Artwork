Dragonheart is based on the 1996 fantasy film of the same name. The player controls Bowen the dragon slayer, through eight levels fighting many dragons and encountering characters from the film, such as Gilbert, Kara and King Einon. The exploration is presented in a 1st-person-view and the battles are presented in a side-scrolling view. The player can get information about the current quest from peasants that are found in the many villages and houses throughout the game. The battles resort only to two buttons, one to attack and other to defend.
