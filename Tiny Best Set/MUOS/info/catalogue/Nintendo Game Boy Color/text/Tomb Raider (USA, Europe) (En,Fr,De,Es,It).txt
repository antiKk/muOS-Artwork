Deep in the jungles of Peru, hidden in a lost temple is the Nightmare Stone, an ancient and magical crystal. In the wrong hands it has the power to destroy the world! 
 
Lara Croft must find the deadly crystal before anyone else, but first she must jump, climb, swim and blast her way through temples, tombs and treasure rooms, facing skeletons, giant snakes and evil spirits in her most action-packed adventure yet!
