The game is based on the comedy TV show Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki, which in its turn is based on a theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings. The game stars characters that either look like the actors from the TV show and/or resemble characters played by them.  
 
The show consists of short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise. Same can be applied to the game: there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally impossible situations the protagonists find themselves in.
