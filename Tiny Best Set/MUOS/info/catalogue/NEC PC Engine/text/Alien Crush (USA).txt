Alien Crush is an alien-themed video pinball game.  The graphics feature strong similarities to the art from the Alien movies, and everything has a dark and sinister look. 
 
The main table has numerous moving targets and ball locks and is two screens high.  There are at least three bonus games that are accessible from the top screen.  Bonus games consist of knocking out moving targets on a separate single-screen bonus table.
