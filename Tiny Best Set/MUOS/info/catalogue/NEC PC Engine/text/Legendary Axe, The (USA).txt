You are the mighty warrior Gogan, whose village has been required  by the Jagu tribe to give a human sacrifice each year. Flare, your childhood friend, has been chosen as the sacrifice. Your task is to rescue Flare and destroy the Jagu and their leader. To help you complete your mission, you are given the Legendary Axe, which is said to possess tremendous power that is usable only to its wielder.  
 
There are six zones in the game and has Gogan exploring forests, caves, mountains, dungeons, and castles, while defeating enemies that get in his way with his axe. Idols can be broken to reveal power-ups that will increase the axe's power and speed up its swing. These power-ups can also award you extra lives, more points, and the ability to access secret areas. At the end of each zone, you have to defeat a boss in order to proceed.
