Originally designed by Evoga to be a sequel to the 1995 fighting game Double Dragon (changing it to a homage after failing to acquire the intellectual rights to the series), Rage of the Dragons is a 2-on-2 tag-team fighting game with the same art style as Noise Factory's earlier Sengoku 3. 
 
The story involves various pairs of martial artists and those with supernatural powers, with everybody having personal motivations for fighting in Sunshine City. Some of these fighters harness the power of dragon spirits (with brothers Billy and Jimmy Lewis controlling the Blue and Red Dragons and main antagonist Johann controlling the Black Dragon).
