Karate Champ © 1984 Data East USA.

A seminal 1-on-1 fighting game set over the course of a karate tournament, Karate Champ was the first game of its type and would influence every game of the fighting genre that followed. Karate Champ's control system utilised a somewhat awkward dual joystick control system, with simultaneous joystick manipulation required to execute even the simplest of kicks.
