Jungle King is a jungle adventure game where players take on the role of Jungle King, a Tarzan-like jungle man, who is going in search of his Jungle Princess, who has been kidnapped by a pair of barbaric cannibals.  
 
Jungle King has four stages, each with its own unique scenarios, so each stage could be considered a separate game in its own right.
