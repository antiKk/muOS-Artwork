A new hero and surprising plot twists offer white-hot excitement! It is the season of KOF! A new chapter in the saga begins! With a story centering around the new hero K' (K Prime), along with an overhauled game system that pits 4-member teams against each other, KOF '99 is sure to raise excitement levels through the roof. The new battle begins here! 
 
Along with K', six new characters and two Kyo Kusanagi clones appear as Edit Mode characters. This means players can choose their favorite from a whopping total of 30 characters! 
 
FOUR MAKES ONE FOR FEARSOME BATTLES 
3-on-3 is old hat. From now on, it's 4-on-4, buster. Each team consists of three contestants, along with the Striker (who specializes in Tag Team attacks and brings new possibilities to battle strategies). Push the B and C buttons simultaneously to summon the Striker at any time during a fight (up to five times in a single match), but don't go nuts! Using the Striker at the right time is the key to victory! 
 
INCREASE YOUR POWER GAUGE ENERGY 
Increasing Power Gauge energy above a certain point lets players stockpile up to three separate Power Gauges. When gauges are sufficiently stockpiled, use them to activate Super Special Moves and awesome feats like the Guard Cancel Emergency Evasion and Guard Cancel Blow-Away Attack. 
 
SELECT YOUR POWER UP MODE 
Use up to three power gauges at once to enter the timed Power Up Mode! There are two types of Power Up Modes to select from by entering special button commands: Counter Mode (press A + B + C to use Super Special Moves whenever you want; can also link normal special moves for Super Cancellation Attacks) or Armor Mode (press B + C + D to increase your defensive power significantly; Super Special Moves cannot be used during this mode).
