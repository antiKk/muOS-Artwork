The Last Blade 2: Heart of the Samurai is a 2D fighting game which features anime-style characters that fight each other with swords, clubs, and even fishing poles. These characters pull off their special moves with that 'quarter-circle-to-half-circle' and 'double-half-circle' controller motions, reminiscent of Street Fighter.
