The object of the game is to make frogs catch flies. Points are won by manipulating a frog so that he jumps off a lily pad and scoops up flying insects with a flashing tongue. Jump him too late and you'll miss. Jump him too far and he'll land in the pond. you'll have to wait for him to swim back before trying again. Day & night action. Catch more flies than an opponent. Or beat your own top score!
